It is one of the first real-world examples of how cyberattacks can be targeted and timed to amplify military forces on the ground by disrupting and even destroying the technology used by enemy forces. The attack, on February 24, launched destructive “wiper” malware called AcidRain against Viasat modems and routers, quickly erasing all the data on the system. The machines then rebooted and were permanently disabled. Thousands of terminals were effectively destroyed in this way.

Broad characterizations of these operations, such as “Russian cyberattack,” obscure the very real and entangled web of cyber actors within Russia that receive varying degrees of support from, approval by, and involvement with the Russian government. This issue brief describes the large, complex, and often opaque network of cyber actors in Russia, from front companies to patriotic hackers to cybercriminals. It analyzes the range and ambiguity of the Russian government’s involvement with the different actors in this cyber web, as well as the risks and benefits the Kremlin perceives or gets from leveraging actors in this group. The issue brief concludes with three takeaways and actions for policymakers in the United States, as well as in allied and partner countries: focus on understanding the incentive structure for the different actors in Russia’s cyber web; specify the relationship any given Russian actor has or does not have with the state, and calibrate their responses accordingly; and examine these actors and activities from Moscow’s perspective when designing policies and predicting the Kremlin’s responses.

In addition, the doctrine stresses electronically attacking hostile airborne radars. The latter are targeted by jammers covering frequency bands of one gigahertz up to 18GHz. Jamming airborne radars is an important part of Russian EW doctrine. Military aircraft use X-band radars (8.5GHz to 10.68GHz) to detect targets in the air, on the ground and at sea. These radars provide fire control for air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons. Russian Army logic is to protect deployments and targets on the ground by jamming airborne radars to deprive military aircraft of fire control information.

		['How OSINT Has Shaped the War in Ukraine','The ability of the Ukrainian government, military, and people to tap into this wealth of information has helped shaped the war in Ukraine’s favor. Militarily, OSINT has allowed the Ukrainian military to track Russian military movements, plans, and operations. Satellite images have given Ukrainians information on areas Russian troops have attacked. Unencrypted radio waves and cell phones have allowed Ukrainians to eavesdrop on Russian communications. Social media posts, from both Russian soldiers and Ukrainian citizens, have shown what the war looks like on the ground, giving Ukrainian officials information on where and how the Russian military is operating. These advantages provided by OSINT have allowed Ukraine to challenge strongly Russia’s stronger, larger, and more technically advanced military.

		['How OSINT Has Shaped the War in Ukraine','Open-source intelligence is information gathered through public sources and then processed, synthesized, and analyzed into intelligence. These public sources can range from commercial satellite images to unencrypted radio messages and public social media posts. In recent decades, the role of OSINT in the intelligence community has increased exponentially due to the increased role the internet plays in our society. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, about 80% of DIA intelligence today comes from open–source material. The ability of the Ukrainian government, military, and people to tap into this wealth of information has helped shaped the war in Ukraine’s favor.

		['Silicon Lifeline Western Electronics at the Heart of Russia s War Machine','Russia s war against Ukraine has relied on Western electronics. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has not gone to plan. Launched in the expectation of a surgical occupation of Ukrainian cities, it has become a grinding attritional struggle that is rapidly degrading the Russian military. This report, which contains an examination of the components and functioning of 27 of Russia’s most modern military systems – including cruise missiles, communications systems and electronic warfare complexes – concludes that the degradation in Russian military capability could be made permanent if appropriate policies are implemented.
